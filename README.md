## What is it?

A single page web app that solves physics problems with constant acceleration.

## Why make this when there are existing online suvat calculators?

This suvat calculator has not only a better design than the others I have seen. It also provides step by step solutions explaining exactly how you could solve the same problem without the calculator.
